AsyncShiftIn
============

A simple library for Arduino to asynchronously read a shift register.

The advantage over the shiftIn tutorial is that while the tutorial
version blocks the Arduino until the entire shift register has been read.
The asynchronous version allows for processing to happen in between shift
register actions.

Note that this library can not make any timing guarantees. All clock periods
should be viewed as minimum durations only. Maximum clock periods are unbounded.
As the shift register clock is generated by the Arduino, the Arduino
controls the shift registers' view of time. Thus, for regular shift registers,
this is not an issue. 

However, when a shift register protocol is used to communicate with a device that
has assumptions on the accuracy of the clock, using AsyncShiftIn may be problematic.
